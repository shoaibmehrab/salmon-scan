# Welcome to the SalmonScan Dataset

The SalmonScan dataset is a collection of images of salmon fish, including healthy fish and fish with two different types of diseases. The dataset consists of three classes of images:

- Fresh salmon
- Salmon with red skin disease
- Salmon with other diseases

This dataset is ideal for use in various computer vision tasks in machine learning and deep learning applications. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or student, the SalmonScan dataset offers a rich and diverse data source to support your projects and experiments.

So, dive in and explore the fascinating world of salmon health and disease!

## Data Overview

The SalmonScan dataset consists of approximately 1,208 images of salmon fish, classified into three classes:

- Fresh salmon (healthy fish with no visible signs of disease), 456 images
- Salmon with red skin disease, 392 images
- Salmon with other diseases, 360 images

Each class contains a representative and diverse collection of images, capturing a range of different perspectives, scales, and lighting conditions. The images have been carefully curated to ensure that they are of high quality and suitable for use in a variety of computer vision tasks.

The dataset is stored in PNG format and is currently without a split into training, validation, and test sets. However, a typical split would be 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test, giving the following counts:

| Split    | Fresh Salmon | Red Skin Disease | Other Diseases | Total |
|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Training | 273          | 235              | 216           | 724   |
| Validation| 91           | 79               | 72            | 242   |
| Test     | 92           | 78               | 72            | 242   |

Whether you are interested in developing new computer vision algorithms, testing existing models, or simply learning about salmon health and disease, the SalmonScan dataset provides an excellent resource for your needs.
